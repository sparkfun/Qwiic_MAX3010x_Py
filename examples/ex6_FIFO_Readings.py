#
# Simple example for the qwiic MAX3010x device
# Outputs all Red/IR/Green values at  about 5Hz by polling the FIFO
# Note, the Hz is slowed down by printing to the python terminal,
# It can be drmatically speed up if printing is omitted or intermittent

# This python library supports the SparkFun Electroncis qwiic 
# qwiic sensor/board ecosystem on a Raspberry Pi (and compatable) single
# board computers.
