# Simple example for the qwiic MAX3010x device
# This takes an average reading at power up and if the reading changes more than 100,
# then print 'Something is there!'.

# This python library supports the SparkFun Electroncis qwiic 
# qwiic sensor/board ecosystem on a Raspberry Pi (and compatable) single
# board computers.
