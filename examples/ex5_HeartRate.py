#
# Simple example for the qwiic MAX3010x device
# This is a demo to show the reading of heart rate or beats per minute (BPM) using
# a Penpheral Beat Amplitude (PBA) algorithm.
#
# It is best to attach the sensor to your finger using a rubber band or other tightening
# device. Humans are generally bad at applying constant pressure to a thing. When you
# press your finger against the sensor it varies enough to cause the blood in your
# finger to flow differently which causes the sensor readings to go wonky.
